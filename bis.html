					    place in the history of our people. The most outstanding of them are 3 biys:
					    <em><strong> Tole bi, Aiteke bi and Kazybek bi.</strong></em> It was quite right when
					    scientists note that the three judges, who are eternally remembered amongst
					    grateful descendants of Tole bi, Kazybek bi, Aiteke bi, - were not only
					    gifted with oratorical art, but had impact on the society.</p>

					Töle Biy comes from the kazakh tribe Dulat, subtribe Zhanys, in the family
					of Alibek Biy. He was the head biy of the <strong> <mark>Kazakh senior juz</mark> </strong>, as well as an
					author, orator, poet, politician and a public figure. He was born in Jaysan
					in what is now Shuy district, Jambyl oblast in 1663. Alibek Biy's father,
					Qudaiberdy Biy was a Khan adviser of Esim Khan's and took part in the battle
					<dfn>"Qataghan Qyrghyny"</dfn>, against the rebellious Khan Tursyn, then ruler of
					Tashkent.In one of his works, Bukhar-zhirau tells about the childhood of Ablai Khan, where he would work
					for Abilmambet and look afterTöle's sheep. In the "Sabalaq" poem,
					Bukhar-zhirau writes about dialogues Töle and Ablai would have. Töle Biy
					even had a nickname for Ablai, <i>"Sabalaq"</i>, for his overgrown
					hair and disheveled appearance. This is a sign that Töle was one of the
					first people to know "Sabalaq" was a boy with a bright future.

				<p class="text mt-4">
					The wise eloquent words, proverbs and sayings are widespread in the country.
					Folklorists and historians collected and studied about the life of Tole bi
					and his role in governing the country. That includes Shoqan Walikhanov,
					Alexey Lyovshin, Grigory Potanin, Аbubakir Divayev and Baltabai Adambayev,
						and others. The Manuscripts Fund of the State Archives of Kazakhstan and
						the Academy of Sciences also contains materials collected from around the
						country. There is still a lot of Tole biy heritage that has not been written
					down or collected.

					heard by khans and sultans. Kazakh people called him "Kaz Dauysty"
					("Loud-voiced Kazbek").

					Kazybek bi was a member of the first diplomatic mission sent to the
					ruler of the Dzhunghars. The negotiations were successful and the Dzhunghars
					returned captured people and stolen livestock. Kazakh legends have preserved
					Kazybek bi’s speech addressed to Dzhungharian ruler and enemies. <q>We are Kazakhs, we
					graze cattle in the steppe. Kazakhs threaten no one, we are peaceful
					nation. If you have come with good intentions — our respond will be
					peaceful! If you don’t want peace — you will get war!</q> - Kazybek bi. The negotiations
					were followed by several visits to the Dzhunghars. Kazybek bi was
					representative of the Kazakh and orator. As the result, the sides came to
					an agreement "to live in harmony and peace in the future".

					During one of

					Dzhungharian captivity. Subsequently he became Khan of Saryarka. Kazybek
					believed that Abylai was strong and genuinely committed to Kazakh people.
					Kazybek bi played a significant role in the destiny of Kazakh people:
					he was one of the initiators of establishment and enhancing of the united
					Kazakh state, protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
					In 1680 under the rule of Tauke Khan Kazybek bi was recognised as the
					senior bi of the Middle Horde. Along with Tole and Ayteke bis he went
					down in the history as the initiator of integration of Kazakh hordes and
					one of the authors of the set of law called "Zhety Zhargy".
